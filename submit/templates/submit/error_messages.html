        <dd>File names for arXiv may only contain <code>a-z A-Z 0-9 . , - _ =</code>. This file name, and any references to this file within other documents in the upload, must be renamed with the allowed character set.</dd>

        <dt id="file-starts-with-hyphen">File name starts with a hyphen. Renamed <code>file_name</code> to <code>new_file_name</code>. Check and modify any file paths that reference this file.</dt>
        <dd>Hyphens are not allowed at the beginning of file names. This file has been automatically renamed to remove the hyphen, but any references to this file in other documents are not automatically corrected.</dd>

        <dd>Files beginning with a . are not allowed and are automatically removed.</dd>

        <dd>Styles that conflict with TeXLive 2016's internal hypertex package, such as espcrc2 and lamuphys, are removed. Instead, a local version of these style packages that are compatible with hypertext will be used.</dd>

        <dd>Files named `uufiles` or `core` or `splread.1st` will conflict with TeXLive 2016 and are automatically removed. These files re.search(r'^xxx\.(rsrc$|finfo$|cshrc$|nfs)', file_name) or re.search(r'\.[346]00gf$', file_name) or (re.search(r'\.desc$', file_name) and file_size < 10) are also automatically removed.</dd>

        <dd>Example files for the Astronomy and Astrophysics macro package aa.cls are not needed for any specific build, removed as unnecessary.</dd>

        <dt id="name-conflict">Name conflict in <code>file_name</code> detected, file removed.</dt>
        <dd>Naming conflicts are caused by files that are TeX-produced output, and can cause potential build corruption and/or conflicts.</dd>

        <dt id="second-unsupported-character">File <code>file_name</code> contains unsupported character \"$&\". Renamed to <code>new_file_name</code>. Check and modify any path references to this file to avoid compilation errors.</dt>

    <h3>File Upload Messages</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt id="deleted-files">Deleted Files</dt>
        <dd>Deleting a file removes it permanently from a submission. It is important to delete any files that are not needed or used during TeX compilation or included in /anc for supplemental information.</dd>

        <dt id="ancillary-files">Ancillary Files</dt>
        <dd>Files that provide supporting content but are not part of a submission's primary document files are moved into an /anc directory. Checking the "Ancillary" box during upload will create an /anc directory and move uploaded files into that directory. To specify ancillary files in a single .tar upload, create the /anc directory and place ancillary files there. This prevents the TeX compiler from including files in the build that may slow or stop the compilation process and cause unwanted errors.</dd>
